<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

<p>Hi! My name is Junhao. You can also call me Kurt. 

</p>
<p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Design from the University of Melbourne, majoring in User Experience Design. I was introduced to design thinking during my final year of my undergraduate degree. Reading MITâ€™s Frame Innovation: Create New Thinking by Design was truly transformative towards my mindset. It illuminated how empathy, iteration, and paradox resolution could lead to innovative solutions, a concept that I strive to dig more into. 

</p>

<p>As part of my studies, I completed two compulsory courses focused on service design: Advanced Interface Prototyping and Interactive Technology Project. These courses not only developed my core user experience skills, but also deepened my understanding of the methodology and principles of service design. Additionally, during the time when I was accomplishing this degree, I have gained relevant experiences in three key areas including AI Chat, Fitness Apps, and Equipment Manufacturer. I contributed to the creation of new features at Tipsy Chat, designed smart equipment user interfaces, responsive systems and user interaction flow for Keep and Parafit. These experiences have given me the vision to research relevant information, test user feedback and implement design ideas in an effective way to solve problems and drive innovation.

</p>

<p>I joined the IXD(Information Experience Design) program at Pratt Institute as a 25 fall student. Here is the link for this program:
